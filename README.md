# What is Underground?

Underground is a few different things. First and foremost, it is a specification to create application repositories that can be hosted on static servers. Second, Underground is a client that lets one browse and install apps from these repositories. _Underground does not publish apps for you. We only make them available, with your express permission and consent, to the Underground network. You host apps and tunnels (repositories) on your own hardware or file server._
