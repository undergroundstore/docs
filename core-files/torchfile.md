# Torchfile

`Torchfiles` are Underground's way of marking an app inside a Tunnel. Each app in your Tunnel *needs* a `Torchfile`, or Underground won't be able to find it.

## Writing `Torchfiles`:
`Torchfiles` are pretty easy to write by hand, which is amazing, because there is no automated tool to generate a `Torchfile` for you. Torchfiles are written in **Pebble** syntax, like a lot of core Underground files. More info about the **Pebble** syntax can be found in the **Pebble** page.

If you're in a hurry, we're working on templates to make the nitty gritty of making core files a little easier. We'll update this page when they're ready.
