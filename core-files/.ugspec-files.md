# .ugspec Files

## Note: This feature has not been implemented or even conceptualised as the Torchfile, Pebble, and the Tunnelfile have. This information will change!

`.ugspec` files allow you to use another syntax for Underground core files, to allow true decentralisation. The feature will not be part of the Underground repos on GitHub, as we don't want to make decisions that will benefit us but not the community. As such, the .ugspec system used in Underground is relinquished to the public domain under [The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org)
