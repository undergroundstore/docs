# Hosting requirements

The hosting requirements for an Underground tunnel are extremely low. This is intentional.

Minimum hosting requirements:

A 5 GB or larger partition on a drive. We recommend NVMe or solid-state storage to make the experience better for users.

The ability to create publicly available direct download links to files stored on the aforementioned disk.



In a hurry? We've created a [template repository](https://github.com/undergroundstore/pages-tunnel) on GitHub using GitHub Pages that you can fork and use!
