The file structure of a tunnel consists of a few different things:

Note that the structure below starts at the root of the partition discussed in[hosting-requirements.md](hosting-requirements.md "mention").

./com.exampledevs.exampleapp/

./com.exampledevs.exampleapp/Torchfile

./Tunnelfile



Note: Torchfiles used by Underground ARE NOT THE SAME as torchfile.py. They are completely unrelated.
