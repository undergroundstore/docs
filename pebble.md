# Pebble

Pebble is a custom human-readable syntax similar to JSON used by Underground for core files.&#x20;



FAQ:

1. Is the Pebble syntax open? A: Yes. Pebble is entirely public under the [The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org).
2. Is Pebble hard to use? A: A six year old could write it. The most archaic thing it does is writing likeThis. And that happens almost never.
3. Do I need to use Pebble to run a Tunnel? A: Sadly, yes, at the moment. We have plans to allow a Tunnelfile line to point to custom syntaxes such as JSON.
4. Can I use and/or modify Pebble for my own projects? A: Yes. Since Pebble is entirely public domain software, you can feel free to use it in your projects. (We'd really appreciate it if you'd credit us with a link to our GitHub page, but it's ultimately your choice!)
